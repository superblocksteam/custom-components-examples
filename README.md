# custom-components-examples

Repository of example custom components built and maintained by the Superblocks team

In order to match the development pattern for custom components, each example component or set of components is uploaded as part of an app directory.

You can easily download any example component from this repository and copy it into your app directory. Be sure to also copy over the `package.json` & `package-lock.json` files to obtain the relevant dependencies.
